Git is a distributed version control system and it is a place to save your code and monitor the changes made to the code over time again and again
where as GitHub is a platform which hosts various git repositories which you have worked on, It will create a portfolio for the developer to display your work
to the recruiters.


Git commands 

all the commands used in git are small case

1) clone: it is used to create a copy of the repository from the github into the local machine when you don't have a copy of the repository.

2) add: It is a git command used to add or update the changes made to the code into the git repository.
Track your files and changes in git

3) git commit is a command to save the changes made to the local repo.
save your changes in git

4) git push is a command used to push the changes into the master branch 
upload git commits to a remote repo, like github.

5) git pull is a command used to get the changes from the remote repo to 
your local machine, the opposite of push.

There could be many branches in the code to check them we can use the "command git branch"
The above command will list the branches available on that repo and * will be present on the branch which you're currently at

you can switch between the branches using the *git checkout branchName*

when you want to create a new branch through locally you can use *git checkout branchName -b "svdhgsdh"

*git status 
Run the above command in a branch to check if any changes are made to the files under the branch and has not been committed or add to the repo
The result of the above command will show the file names that has been created or updated, if the file is created then we have to add the file 
before we commit the changes, However, If you're making changes to the existing file then we can skip add command and run
git commit -am "changes description" Here a represents adding and m represent message.

*git merge is a command used to merge the sub branch to the main branch, sub branches are created because more than one developer can be working
on the main branch and so each developer can create a sub branch for there work and merge it with the main branch.
when a merge command is execu it locally, 2 things happens
1) a pull Request(PR) is generated to merge the branches and there is a high chance conflicts can happen during the merge operations.
2) you can resolve the pull request from the sub branch to main branch through the GitHub or update the files locally and the code editor will guide you
regarding the conflicting changes it will highlight the areas, you have to handle the code changes manually in code editor like keeping the parts that are necessary
and removing the unnecessary parts.


*fork will be present in GitHub on top right corner it's basic purpose is, consider we are going through the public repo's of other developers and we can't make 
any changes to there repos, we can fork the repos and add it into our local repos and make changes as our repo's and if things are fine you can raise the 
merge request to the original repo so that the developer can go through the code and accept the changes if they seem fine

*git diff
the above command is used to check the differences in 2 branches like main and sub branch

*git reset or something 
*git reset HARD~1 // it will go to the point of previous commit
this command are basically used to unstage or go the previous commit point


*git log
when you run this command you can see all the logs generated with the log id's 
you can use the specific log id along with above reset command to reset the code to that particular commit


There are 2 important things you have to watch out for are
1) How you create clone for the repo from github into the local machine
This is done by taking SSH like git@github.com:Sampath6250/Git-practice.git
from the repo inside the github and running the command 
git clone git@github.com:Sampath6250/Git-practice.git

This is how the files are cloned locally when we have no file in the local machine

2) how you push the local commits into the github 
in order to prove to the github that you're the owner of the github account, which is usually done using the SSH keys

2.1 
to do this we have to generate the ssh keys locally
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sampathraosam@gmail.com"
rsa is type of encryption and 4096 is strength of the encryption

2.2
Once ssh keys are generated you need to add the ssh keys to the SSH agent

Below are the commands to check if ssh is running or not 
once you are in c://Users//user path
run 
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
output: Agent pid 240

adding ssh key to the ssh agent
User@Sampath MINGW64 ~/.ssh
$ ssh-add id_rsa
Identity added: id_rsa (sampathraosam@gmail.com)

command to check the ssh keys present in the ssh agent
User@Sampath MINGW64 ~/.ssh
$ ssh-add -l
4096 SHA256:CQgbQaE/NOC+UGwMF+ue0BUa2AkqcuCwhsBcQUK7Mi0 sampathraosam@gmail.com (RSA)
